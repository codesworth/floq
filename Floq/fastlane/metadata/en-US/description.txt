Floq is a location based photo sharing app that allows you to create and join live collective albums called Cliq's to share photos with people around you in a unique way.  Any cliq you create or join will become an album that you can interact with at anytime.  Imagine walking into a party, event, or rally and having instant access to all the shared pictures others have taken with Floq.

Create, share, and experience...photo sharing the way it was meant to be.
